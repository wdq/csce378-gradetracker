******************** Startup Instructions ********************
  * Platform:
    - It's entirely client side Javascript, CSS, and HTML,
      so it should work on any platform with a modern browser.
    - It was developed and tested using Chrome 56.0.2924.87,
      on Windows 10.
      
  * Software Requirements:
    - Modern web browser.
    
  * Starting It Up:
    1. Extract the GradeTracker.zip, or clone this repo:
       https://github.com/wdq/csce378-gradetracker.git
    2. Open the extracted folder.
    3. Open the index.html file in the root of the folder
       in your web browser (drag and drop to a tab works).
    4. The page should quickly refresh on the first load,
       and then display example classes (ELEC 304, CSCE 361).
    5. There is also a demo available at:
