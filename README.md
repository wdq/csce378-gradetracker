Since this is just a prototype we should be able to fake everything without the need for a web server. That idea is that you just open the file directly in your web browser, and use relative links from there.

I've included some basic libraries we will be needing, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for the base layout and syling, [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) for tables, and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

We can persist data for users through browser data, and use URL parameters where needed. Javascript isn't great, but it should work for a simple prototype.
